== Notes #1

=== Commands

Some stuff I probably shouldn't forget and at some point wrap in a shell
function or in Phing build.xml

- `phpcs --standard=vendor/magento-ecg/coding-standard/Ecg $PWD/app/code/local/Servicing` e.g. from mage root

NOTE: Composer can be a bit unyielding in operation and management of versions. Usually it takes a few tries
to figure out how to properly pull in a package if not clearly mentioned in a README.

- you might be able to install some latest version packages using: `composer require "someuser/somepkg":"*"`
- using the wildcard asterix `*` to create ``unbound version constraints'' is not advisable however 
- chances are you need to add to `composer.json` the ``extra'' key with the hash ``minimum-stability''
  and value ``dev'' then you can use `composer require "bleeding/edge":"dev-master"`
- magerun has a different composer install method: `composer create-project n98/magerun`?? nope
