== Conjurer's Ethereal Oil (level 10)

First and foremost, let it be known that working with Magento is more than just
'web development'. There are, amongst Mage developers, a portion of people who
code not for fun or profit, but simply as a display of their craft as an art
form. They might not like Magento all that much, and, in a way that may
be...unique, or unusual. Sometimes they may not even be into PHP itself, and I
would venture to say that being a "Conjurer" puts you in that weird, untitled
category. Henceforth, Conjurer is your name!

Becoming a Conjurer has various implications, the first of which being that you
will sacrifice the bulk of your development time nitpicking weird, random
brainfarts from the past, whether they be of http://phpsadness.com/[PHP] or
http://magentomadness.wordpress.com/[Magento] originated madness.
